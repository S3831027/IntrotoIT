<h1 style="color:Dodgerblue;">My IT Profile</h1>
<p><b>Basic Background:</b>I am 42 years old and have been working for the WA State Government for approximately 14 years.  My first role in WA State Government was as a Transit Guard providing security and passenger services on trains.  On one shift I assisted my supervisor with connecting a printer and my passion for IT started immediately.  I had previously setup computers and basic IT at home but the reward I received in that single moment started my current career.  I went from earning over $100,000 a year in a security role to starting in a service desk position earning less that half the money but getting the daily reward of solving problems.</p>
<p>Since starting as a service desk officer, I have managed a service desk, lead the upgrade projects of multimillion-dollar system upgrades and completed the whole of Government Key Performance Indicator reporting for the 2018 reporting cycle.  I have enjoyed my career however have never completed formal IT training, other than online Microsoft sessions or attended group scenarios.  I looked within the TAFE environment however I could not find any qualifications without attending classes for a year.  I found this course within RMIT and signed up immediately.  Once completing this course, I will look at continuing my education.</p>
<p><b>Ideal Job:</b>Ultimately, I would love to become a Chief Information Officer within WA State Government bringing a team of staff to achieve amazing things.  I have been privileged with some great leaders that I believe I have learnt leadership capabilities however at that level within ICT, more and more Agencies are seeking qualifications which I currently do not possess.</p>
<p>Office of the Auditor General - Chief Information Officer - <a href="url">https://search.jobs.wa.gov.au/page.php?pageID=466&windowUID=0&AdvertID=245804</a></p>
<p>This particular position is a leadership role that strives for greater efficiencies and effectiveness that I believe I have demonstrated in my current role and the opportunity I had to transfer to the Officer of the Government Chief Information Officer â€“ Associate Director Strategic Business Transformation.  The concern I have with applying for these types of roles is my ability to address the selection criteria and be competitive against other applicants.  I have had opportunities in technical and non-technical roles however detailing these skills against a selection criteria is my downfall.  By completing this course along with developing a better application, I hope to gain the type of roles that will ultimately get the Chief Information Officer role.</p>
